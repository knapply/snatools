## Overview

`snatools` is still _very_ experimental; the current API and dependencies are subject to change.


`snatools` has four immediate goals meant to increase analyst efficiency and reduce the cognitive load of network newcomers (and those instructing them):

1. Accurately bridge existing graph frameworks (i.e. `igraph` and `network`).
2. Streamline network analytic workflows by making common tasks as intuitive (and stable) as possible.
3. Implement metrics that are missing from R's network ecosystem.
    + Reimplement those that _should_ be made more accessible, efficient, or robust.
4. Standardize fundamental tasks with methods that bypass the issues of `igraph` vs `network` namespace conflicts.


<!-- Additionally, `snatools` seeks to prepare for the future by establishing the foundation (or a set of lessons-learned) for an enhanced network framework that: -->

<!-- 1. continues to be compatible with legacy frameworks. -->
<!-- 2. can be extended to take advantage of modern and future R's ecosystem . -->
<!--     + Optimization? `Rcpp`, C++'s Boost Graph Library, Python's graph-tool (heavily C++), CUDA -->
<!--     + Data Frame Efficiency? `data.table` -->
<!--     + Spatial Vector Data? `sf` -->
<!--     + Intuitive Code? `tidyverse`  -->
<!--         + `tidygraph` and `ggraph` may still be maturing, but they've rendered many legacy workflows for graph manipulation and plotting obsolete. -->
<!--     + Next Generation Tools? [Apache Arrow](https://arrow.apache.org/) is coming. -->


## Installation

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("knapply/snatools")

library(snatools)
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
library(snatools)
```

## Features

### Simple, Accurate Conversion Between Frameworks

`snatools` allows `igraph` and `network` to play together better than ever.

`igraph` objects can be easily converted to `network` objects...

```{r}
crisis_in_cloister %>% # an igraph object
  as_network()
```

... and back again.

```{r}
crisis_in_cloister %>% 
  as_network() %>% 
  as_igraph()
```

The same goes for bipartite graphs.

```{r}
southern_women %>% # igraph to network
  as_network()
```


Additionally, everything in `snatools` was designed from the ground-up to work with both `igraph` and `network` objects.

## Modern Subsetting

```{r}
crisis_in_cloister %>% 
  edg_subset(time == 3 & affect > 0) %>% 
  vrt_subset(cloisterville)
```


## Standardized Representations

The essential graph `rep_`resentations are all available.

* Adjacency Lists

```{r}
florence %>% 
  edg_subset(relation == "marriage") %>% 
  rep_as_adj_list()
```

* Edge Lists

```{r}
jemmah_islamiyah %>% 
  rep_as_edgelist() %>% 
  head()
```

* Adjacency Matrices

```{r}
crisis_in_cloister %>%
  edg_subset(time == 2) %>% 
  rep_as_adj_matrix(edg_attr = "affect") %>% 
  `rownames<-`(regmatches(rownames(.), regexpr("^\\w{,4}", rownames(.)))) %>% 
  `colnames<-`(rep("", ncol(.)))
```

Along with others that are less common.

* Mixing Matrices

```{r}
data("samplk", package = "ergm")

samplk1 %>%
  rep_as_mixing_matrix(vrt_attr = "group")
```

## Data Frame Methods

Modern R is all about data frames, so using them in network analysis should be easy.

`tibble`s are the focus as the `statnet` suite already imports `tidyverse` packages.

```{r}
crisis_in_cloister %>% 
  vrt_as_df()

crisis_in_cloister %>% 
  edg_as_df()
```

## More Metrics

```{r}
library(ggplot2)

samplk1 %>% 
  ei_index(vrt_attr = "group", scope = "vertex") %>% 
  autoplot()
```
