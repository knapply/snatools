#' Sampson's Monastery
#' 
#' `crisis_in_cloister` is an adaptation of the [Pajek](http://mrvar.fdv.uni-lj.si/pajek/)
#' dataset "Sampson.paj" ("Sampson.net" specifically). \cr
#' 
#' From the Pajek documentation: \cr
#' 
#' The data stem from an ethnographic study of community structure in a New England 
#' monastery by Samuel F. Sampson. The study describes several social relations among a 
#' group of men (novices) who were preparing to join a monastic order.
#' 
#' The data sets presented here contain the affect relations among the novices, which 
#' were collected by asking them to indicate whom they liked most and whom they liked 
#' least. The novices were asked for a first, second, and third choice on both 
#' questions. The social relations were measured at five moments in time. The fourth 
#' measurement (at time T4) took place one week before four of the novitiates were 
#' expelled from the monastery. Some novices had attended the minor seminary of 
#' 'Cloisterville' before they came to the monastery.
#' 
#' Based on his observations and analyses, Sampson divided the novices into 
#' four groups: Young Turks, Loyal Opposition, Outcasts, and an interstitial group. The
#' Loyal Opposition consists of the novices who entered the monastery first. The Young 
#' Turks arrived later, in a period of change. They questioned practices in the 
#' monastery, which the members of the Loyal Opposition defended. Some novices did not 
#' take sides in this debate, so they are labeled 'interstitial'. The Outcasts are 
#' novices who were not accepted in the group.
