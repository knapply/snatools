#' Jemaah Islamiyah cell that was responsible for the Bali bombings 
#' in 2002 – i.e. should tally with the other Bali bombing dataset from JJATT. The 
#' recording of the interaction of the cell began following the  meeting in the Hotel 
#' Harem in Denpasar on October 6, when the group was considered to go ‘operationally 
#' covert’, and concluded when the majority of the group had left Bali before the 
#' implementation of the operation on October 11, 2002.
