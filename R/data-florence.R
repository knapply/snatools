#' Padgett's Florentine Families

#' `florence` is an adaptation of the [Pajek](http://mrvar.fdv.uni-lj.si/pajek/)
#' dataset "Padgett.paj". \cr

#' Breiger & Pattison (1986), in their discussion of local role analysis, use a subset of 
#' data on the social relations among Renaissance Florentine families (person aggregates) 
#' collected by John Padgett from historical documents. The two relations are business 
#' ties (PADGB - specifically, recorded financial ties such as loans, credits and joint 
#' partnerships) and marriage alliances (PADGM).
#' 
#' As Breiger & Pattison point out, the original data are symmetrically coded. This is 
#' acceptable perhaps for marital ties, but is unfortunate for the financial ties (which
#' are almost certainly directed). To remedy this, the financial ties can be recoded as 
#' directed relations using some external measure of power - for instance, a measure of 
#' wealth. PADGW provides information on (1) each family's net wealth in 1427 (in 
#' thousands of lira); (2) the number of priorates (seats on the civic council) held 
#' between 1282- 1344; and (3) the total number of business or marriage ties in the total 
#' dataset of 116 families (see Breiger & Pattison (1986), p 239).
#' 
#' Substantively, the data include families who were locked in a struggle for political 
#' control of the city of Florence in around 1430. Two factions were dominant in this 
#' struggle: one revolved around the infamous Medicis (9), the other around the powerful 
#' Strozzis (15).
