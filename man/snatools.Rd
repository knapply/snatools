\title{snatools: An R toolkit to bridge graph classes and streamline network analytic workflows.}
\description{
A collection of functions and data sets to simplify programmatic network analyis.
It conveniently bridges the \code{igraph} and \code{network} classes in in a way that is more robust
\emph{and} more flexible than other available methods. The goals are to simplify network-centric
workflows, improve analyst efficiency, and reduce the cognitive load of network newcomers
and those instructing them.
